<h1> Recommendations!!</h1>

    <p>
        <h2>I love playing games and these are my recommendations</h2>
        <Ul>
            <li>Metal gear solid 3: it is about to get a rerelease and is a great introduction into one of the greatest game series ever made.</li>
            <li>Doom (2016): It is a faithful reimagining of the classic series in a fun and action packed way that can bring anyone into the series</li>
            <li>Marvel Spider-Man for the PS4: It is one of the most fun and innovative games on the Playstation systems and has a sequel already out and one coming out soon as well so now is the perfect time to get into the series.</li>
            <li>Halo Master Chief Collection: This is an amazing steal you get all of the greatest halo games for the price of a single game. You can experience 6 different amazing story modes and their respective wonderful multiplayer modes.</li>
        </Ul>
        These are my suggestions, they are all fairly basic but amazing picks I think everyone should try.
